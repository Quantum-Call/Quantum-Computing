La historia del cómputo cuántico.


I did not have the fortune to take a quantum computing class in college, not
to speak of a course in quantum machine learning. At the time, it wouldn’t
have been much fun either. In the early 2000s, quantum computing was just
about to take the step from a pure theory to evaluation in research labs. It
was a field for theoretical physicists and mathematicians.

it was around 2008, researchers had successfully entangled qubits and were
able to control them. Then, of course, Star Trek-like transportation came to
mind when I heard two physically apart particles could share a state so that
it was possible to change the state of one particle by observing the other.
Yet, until around 2014, I did not pay much attention. I was too busy writing my doctoral dissertation about assessing the effort caused by the requirements in a software development project. When I returned to everyday life,
I was just right in time to experience the end of the second AI winter and the
adventofpracticalmachinelearning. Whathadbeentheorythusfarbecame
