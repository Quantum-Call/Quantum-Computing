1. What is the dimensionality of the vector $\ket{01101}$?
- La dimensión es de $2^5$: 32

2. If we measure the state:

$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{00} + \ket{11})$$

In the basis $\ket{00}, \ket{01},\ket{10},\ket{11}$ what we obtain?

- $\ket{00}$ con probabilidad de $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ o $\ket{00}$ con probabilidad de $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ NO

- $\ket{00}$ con probabilidad de $\frac{1}{2}$ o $\ket{11}$ con probabilidad de $\frac{1}{{2}}$

_______________________

3. Is the following expression correct?

$$\ket{00} + \ket{11} = (\ket{0}+\ket{1})(\ket{0}+\ket{1})$$


- Yes/ Mala
- NO es la respuesta

4. Stern-Gerlach Experimento show that?

- a) Some particles have a measurable property called spin. For silver atoms and electrons their spin along any axis has two distinguishable values, thus they represent two-level systems and can be used for implementation of qubits. /R


b) Electrons in any atom rotate around its core in the same plane everywhere in Universe. Niels Bohr called this the greatest mystery of quantum mechanics.

5. The entangled states like 

$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{00} + \ket{11})$$
or

$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{01} + \ket{10})$$

Are interesting because thease reasons:

- a) These are 4-qubit states, the only known up to this moment/ NO
- b) If we measure one of the particles in this state, we actually measure both of them (even if another particle is far away) /R
- c) These are the states of two particles, however each of these particles doesn't have it's own state /YES
- d) These states appear when particles interact with each other. We can't prepare such states without particles interaction /NO
- e) These are the only quantum states we can implement on flipping coins /NO
