Classical computers are everywhere in the form of supercomputers, smartphones, and laptops. Advances in classical computation have become a catalyst for many scientific and technological innovations, but there are still many problems that are difficult for classical computers to solve. Examples of such computational tasks include modeling natural processes like determining molecular structure and problems that have large state spaces for possible outcomes like the Travelling Salesperson Problem. Quantum computers are projected to have the ability to solve these kinds of problems in a much more efficient manner than the best-known classical approaches.  

Quantum computing resources are targeted for applications in chemistry, optimization, security, and machine learning. While current quantum hardware, which we will discuss in the next section, may be modest in size, experiments have already demonstrated that the technique in which quantum information encodes data allows for significant computational gains. We do not yet have large enough quantum computers to implement notable quantum algorithms such as Shor’s algorithm for factoring, but it is anticipated that more robust quantum computers will appear in the decades to come.
