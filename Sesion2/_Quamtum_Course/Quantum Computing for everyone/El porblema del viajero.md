Visit the website that hosts a [simulation of the Traveling Salesman Problem](https://www-m9.ma.tum.de/games/tsp-game/index_en.html) that optimizes for the shortest path. Pick a map and complete the simulation at least twice, once with 10 stops and once with 30 stops. For each simulation, take note of the length of the optimal tour, length of your tour, and calculation time (how long it took the computer to find the optimal route). Afterwards, feel free to continue experimenting with the simulator by varying the number of included cities each time.

Consider the following questions:

-   Were you always able to find the optimum route?
-   As the number of cities on the route increased, how did the amount of time it took the computer to find the optimal route change?

As the number of cities increases in the Traveling Salesman simulation, so do your connection options in your attempt to optimize for the shortest path between them all. Because of the way classical computers store information, they are inefficient at solving optimization problems, taking long periods of time to search for the optimum set of variables that generates the best outcome for reducing cost, or in this case, total distance travelled.  The way quantum computers store information could potentially allow them to solve complex optimization problems, like the Travelling Salesman Problem, much quicker than classical computers can. 

In this course, we will learn about some of the advantages that quantum computers have, as well as the constraints that exist. In other words, we will explore the types of operations quantum computers can do quickly or compactly that allows them to outperform classical computers for certain problems. We will also discuss the things classical computers can do that quantum computers cannot!
